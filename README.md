Inspiration
This script provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for removing duplicate rows from a CSV file. 
It utilizes the PySimpleGUI library for creating the GUI and the pandas library for data manipulation.
One of my first projects using PySimpleGUI was in 2019, when I created my first psych report assistant. Ever
since, I have been fascinated with GUIs in Python. So after learning about the pandas library, I decided to 
try out this feature in the data analytics field, and in my amazement, it worked. I am excited about my Python
journey and hope to share it with the world. To use, simply open the application, upload a datafile (csv) and click
clean data. The tool will generate a report, with the number of duplicate rows found, and populate a clean csv dataset.
